### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Towards the end of a training cycle. Brought on by a sudden increase in intensity/longer hard workouts. High amounts of dull pain
running up and down both shins before and after a run, never during a run.

### What was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

Still currently out. Took 4 weeks off after a goal race. Tried to come back to training at about the same mileage I was at before. 
Injury came back within two weeks. Doctor limited me to swimming and biking for two more weeks before building mileage back up from 0.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Immediately drop mileage according to level of pain and add in more swimming/biking on easy days. 
Trying to push it/sticking exactly to the plan will ultimately keep me out longer.
