### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Usually came about when my shoes were old (over 1,000 miles). Mileage was around 60-70 per week.

### What was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didnâ€™t help)?

I got new shoes, cross-trained and rested for a couple of weeks, until the pain was gone, and I was good to go.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Buy new shoes and rest right away.

### Additional notes

I now replace my shoes about every 500-700 miles. Does the trick.
