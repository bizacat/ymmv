### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

After a hard training week where I had become slack on foam rolling.Symptoms are pain in the hip joint rather than a particular muscle

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didnâ€™t help)?

Have had to completely stop running. Tried strengthening the glute/hip flexor without luck. Now focusing on improving joint mobility.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Foam rolling
