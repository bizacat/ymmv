### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Noticed about when every step hurt, mileage issue because it was my first time running ever and my form was garbage

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

Icing and strengthening glutes helped a ton, fixed in 2-3 months

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Stop running and work hips/glutes and focus on form and good technique
