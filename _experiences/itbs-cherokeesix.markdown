### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Very sudden. Came about from increased mileage for Marathon training.

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

Almost two months of no running, followed by several weeks of very light running. Hip strengthening, foam rolling, and physical therapy helped me recover.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Hit the foam roller! Almost 2 years later, I still notice tightness in my right knee if my quads get too tight.m,
