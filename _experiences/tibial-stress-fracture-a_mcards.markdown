### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

I had noticed some pain early on in the track season but kept pushing forward. Definitely due to taking easy runs too aggressive and not properly recovering. Finally threw in the towel once I was having night terrors and putting pants on hurt my shin. Yay high school mindset!

### What was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

It took forever. But it should when you have two tibial stress fractures an inch apart, right? The season that hit me the hardest wasn’t my first time with shin pain, or my last. What has really helped is focusing on form when doing strides and adding lifting into my routine. I think my glutes were (and still are) week and so the cascade or overworking certain areas took its toll. Swimming was my savior because it definitely got me working harder than I ever could try on a bike.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

I’ve had a few pings since my last tibial stress fracture/reaction (2013) and ever time it happens I just would tell my coach “hey I’m going to take it easy for a few days.” I refuse to take time off for getting injured out of stupidity. Listen to your body!!!

### Additional Notes

The season I had the two stress fractures was my senior year of high school and it made the transition into college training merely impossible with all the time off. Talk about starting from behind the pack.
