### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Noticed it after running three 30k trail races (after each one.) Diagnosed with midfoot dysfunction (a frequent diagnosis for me). Was keeping steady mileage (40s) for 3-4 months but these were the longest and most intense runs I was doing on the trails, which was probably too much for my feet.

### What was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

Since I had it before I immediately knew I needed physical manipulation by licensed PTs who fixed the issues within 1-3 two-minute visits where they fixed the cuboid into place with different techniques. Kept trying to run trails (easy) and do strength work to make sure it didn’t happen again. Simple rest does not make this injury go away.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Keep up with stability exercises and cross training, building mileage slowly.  Incorporate regular trail running for built-in ankle strengthening work.
