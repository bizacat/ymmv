### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

A year before it actually flared, my foot arch was feeling VERY tense but i never looked into it.

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didnâ€™t help)?

1 week no running. Putting my feet inside hot water with salt helped a lot. Rolling the arch with a frozen water bottle.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

cross training even helps the feet!
