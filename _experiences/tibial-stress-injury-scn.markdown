### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Began training for half marathon after four months off of running (and not a ton of mileage before that). Thought my mileage was low enough (15-20 mpw) that I didn’t need to take too much time ramping up; started to feel tightness in left shin about five weeks in. Because I was worried about it getting worse, I ended up skipping a bunch of the midweek runs to lower my mileage, but I was scared about not being prepared enough for my half so tried to keep to the long run schedule. In hindsight, it was kind of idiotic to have more than half of my miles each week be my long run, and I think that was what got it worse. Ended up basically resting for my taper and taking a few weeks off after the race (during which I had no shin pain). Resumed running 10-15 mpw again, reasoning that I’d be fine with such low mileage, but started to do more intervals and tempos, and my shin started feeling worse after each run – not just tight but a genuinely bad/hurt feeling, like a bruise toward the bony part of the inside of my left shin. I think a large part of what brought it about was that I was wearing shoes (Asics GT2000-2s) for mild overpronators, when a gait analysis during later physical therapy revealed I had a pretty neutral stride and even supinate slightly on the left (the side of the injury). It also became apparent that my left side (glutes especially) is a lot weaker than my right.

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

Was referred to physical therapy and began doing exercises to strengthen my left glute and hips, as well as my core. Took a whole month off. Did consistent yoga and core work. Now building up again, super slowly, without speed work, and taking rest days if I feel that initial tightness again. I stay mindful of my cadence and try to be light on my feet and do heel/toe walks and calf raises after runs. And running in NB Zantes, which feel SO much better and allow me to push off my big toes way more, which was advice from my PT.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Buy new shoes and rest right away.

### Additional notes

No matter how low your mileage is, if you’re starting from zero after taking some time off, take it SUPER EASY. Make sure your long run isn’t more than 1/3 of your weekly mileage, max. Replace some runs with aerobic cross-training if needed/you’re afraid of losing fitness. Keep up with strength work and yoga. Run in neutral shoes unless you know for sure you .
