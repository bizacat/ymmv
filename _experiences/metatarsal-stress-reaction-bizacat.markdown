### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Pain came on suddenly during a run. As a relatively new runner, increased mileage too quickly (went from 40s to 64miles in one week), didn’t rest after 2nd marathon, ran first trail race (25k) two weeks later, etc. Severe sharp pain on top of foot. Thought it was from shoelaces tied too tightly and had to take shoe off to finish walking 2mi back to the gym. Didn’t get any x-rays but the doctor was certain it was bone stress.

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didn’t help)?

Was told 6-8 weeks. Took me 10. I did not wear a boot and had to walk a bit more than I would have liked for work/to get to the gym to cross train. Aqua jogged and workout out at the gym on the elliptical, bike, with weights, etc. though sometimes the elliptical would hurt. Came back very, very slowly starting with run/walking with 2-5 minute intervals for 3-4 weeks before running a full mile or two at a time. It felt sore at first but I was told that was sort of normal and came back without another incident. Came back to running too quickly though and got an unrelated tendon injury 2 months later. Don’t do that.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Be patient and know that there is a finite end to it. Don’t rush the recovery and absolutely take the comeback to running as seriously as you did your regular training. Coming back too fast will lead to another problem down the road.
