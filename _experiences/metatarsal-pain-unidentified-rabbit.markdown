### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Ran on the road, slightly inclined from left to right and had to keep my left foot turned to left.

### hat was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didnâ€™t help)?

Took 3 days off. Apparently every pain occurs I can fix by letting it happen and try to relax properly.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

I let it hurt, try not to tense any muscle.
