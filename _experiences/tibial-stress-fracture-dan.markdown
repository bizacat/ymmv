### When did you begin to notice the injury? Are you aware of what may have brought it about such as sudden increase of mileage, other injuries, etc? What were the symptoms?

Severe pain in front of leg (tibia) just below patella tendon attachment

### What was your recovery process like? How long did it take and what were some of the things you tried that ultimately helped (or didnâ€™t help)?

8-10 weeks to being able to run again. I spent that time on a stationary bike (it was a snowy winter). I took twice the daily recommended dosage of ibuprofen the entire time to bring down inflammation.

### If you received this injury again, what would you do knowing what you know now?

Stop running immediately, turn all workouts into bike workouts

### Additional notes

I have had a multitude of injuries, including several stress fractures, strained muscles, Achilles tendinitis, and IT band issues. I had all of these within a 2 year period. Since then, I have done one major thing to prevent more injuries: run slower. I run more slowly on average, but mainly on non-workout days. I found that I can run 7:20-7:30 miles instead of 6:40-7:00 miles and still improve performances at all distances 800m-8k.
